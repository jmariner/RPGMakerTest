general
	afaik $gameActors is the live data and $dataActors, $dataClasses, etc, are the data loaded from JSON
	so edit the $game____ variables to make changes

profs: use the "param" field on classes; apply a formula to each one
	param items are in order: Max HP, Max MP, Atk, Def, Magic attack, magic def, agility, luck
	use _paramPlus on Game_BattlerBase instead of editing raw param data
